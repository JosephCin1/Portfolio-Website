Placeholder for resume.

To include your PDF resume in the site, place a file named `resume.pdf` at:

  docs/assets/resume.pdf

Then the Resume link on the site will download it. GitHub Pages serves files from `docs/` automatically when configured in repository settings (or choose the `docs` folder in Pages source).
